# BBus_12thProject
This was my 12th grade project, BBus. I found this code while going through my email. With the date of email I assume it was completed on 27 January 2017. Most of the libraries used in this program is no longer in C++ standard libraries. Still I would like to keep this as something I achived only with my text book knowledge as a newbie to programming. Happy to share this HERE!
